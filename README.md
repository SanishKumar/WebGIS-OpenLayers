# Voice enabled user interface for geospatial map based web-applications

Developing a library or proof-of-concept for voice-enabled user-interface for geospatial map based web applications. The solution is supposed to be lightweight and scalable and preferably leverage GPUs/NPUs available on modern devices rather than online libraries for voice command recognition.

## Objectives
-> Develop a voice-activated system that can accurately interpret and execute user commands related to user interface of map based web application.

-> Demonstrate integration/compatibility with existing web GIS applications using libraries such as Leaflet and OpenLayers.

-> Ensure the system is user-friendly and accessible, even for non-technical users.

-> Utilize the computational power of GPUs/NPUs to enhance the performance and responsiveness of the system. (preferable but not mandatory)

## Dataset
-> Open access WMS services and their descriptions for e.g. OSM layers, WMS Services from Bhoonidhi/Bhuvan, NASA Worldview. Copernicus e.t.c

## Tools/Technologies
-> Programming languages: Python, JavaScript

-> Machine Learning frameworks: Tensorflow/TensorFlow.js (lightweight js port of tensorflow)

-> Voice recognition APIs: Google Speech-to-Text, Microsoft Azure Speech Service

-> GIS libraries: Leaflet, OpenLayers

-> NPU/WebGL libraries and SDKs.
