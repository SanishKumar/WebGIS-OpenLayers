# Voice enabled user interface for geospatial map based web-applications.

Develop a library or proof-of-concept for voice-enabled user-interface for geospatial map based web applications. The solution should be lightweight and scalable and preferably leverage GPUs/NPUs available on modern devices rather than online libraries for voice command recognition.

## Objectives
-> Develop a voice-activated system that can accurately interpret and execute user commands related to user interface of map based web application.

-> Demonstrate integration/compatibility with existing web GIS applications using libraries such as Leaflet and OpenLayers.

-> Ensure the system is user-friendly and accessible, even for non-technical users.

-> Utilize the computational power of GPUs/NPUs to enhance the performance and responsiveness of the system. (preferable but not mandatory)

## Expected Outcomes
-> A fully functional prototype of a voice-activated geospatial web GIS system.

-> Demonstration of the system's ability to process voice commands and execute geospatial queries. For e.g. Please zoom to Ahmedabad, please show me the road layer, please show me the highways.

-> An evaluation report detailing the system's performance, including speed, accuracy.

## Dataset Required:
-> Open access WMS services and their descriptions for e.g. OSM layers, WMS Services from Bhoonidhi/Bhuvan, NASA Worldview. Copernicus e.t.c

## Suggested Tools/Technologies:
-> Programming languages: Python, JavaScript
-> Machine Learning frameworks: Tensorflow/TensorFlow.js (lightweight js port of tensorflow)
-> Voice recognition APIs: Google Speech-to-Text, Microsoft Azure Speech Service
-> GIS libraries: Leaflet, OpenLayers
-> NPU/WebGL libraries and SDKs.
